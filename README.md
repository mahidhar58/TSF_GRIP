# Prediction using Supervised learning
In this task, we should build a model to predict the percentage scored by a student based on their studying hours.<br>
Import the required libraries. 
Retrieve the data and analyse it to prepare for further steps.<br>
Split the data into training and testing sets.<br>
Since the data has only 2 variables, we can use linear regression to build our model.
After building the model, train it with training data set.
Then, test the model against testing data set.<br>
Evaluate the model using R2 score or Mean Squared Error or Root Mean Squared Error.<br>
Give the input to predict the score.
