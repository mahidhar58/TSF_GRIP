# Decision Tree Classifier
In this task, we will try to classify the flowers into their species with Decision Tree Classifier.<br>
Import the required libraries. Retrieve the data and analyse it to prepare for further steps.<br>
Split the data into training and testing sets.<br>
Prepare the Decision Tree Classifier with the required criterion for testing quality of the split as 'gini' for gini index, 'entropy' for Information gain.<br>
Plot the Decision Tree with the help of 'plot_tree', you can have the annotations, if required.<br>
Predict the labels, if required.<br>
Decision Tree class has an in-built function to calculate the accuracy of the model.<br>
You can check the configurations of the Decision Tree classifier with the in-built methods.
